I collaborated with my study group (John Coakley, Jason Xie, and Jessica Guico) on this project.

I had a lot of trouble with this project and spent many many hours working on it. I am happy that the core functionality is working and mostly organized. The formatting is incomplete and I have not finished the functionality to save recent searches as buttons. I will continue updating this project, but unfortunately I ran out of time before deadline.
